It looks like there is an\n","invisible boundary around a character which obscures a portion of the previous\n","character.  There is no problem between the characters when the shell returns\n","a complete line of text... only when the output is a series of individual\n","characters.\n","\n","If anyone has any ideas what the problem might be, or where I should look to\n","find it, it would be much appreciated.\n","\n","Regards and thanks, Jon Dhuse.\n","\n","-- \n"," Jon Dhuse              |     Internet: jdhuse@sedona.intel.com\n"," Intel  Corp.
