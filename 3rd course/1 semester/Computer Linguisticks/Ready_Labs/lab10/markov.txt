That is truer than you.You have brains in your shoes. You can steer yourself any 
direction you choose. You’re on your own.The more things you will know. The 
more that you learn, the more that you read, the more things you 
will know. The more things you will know. The more that you read, 
the more things you will know. The more that you read, the more 
that you read, the more places you’ll go.Think left and think high. Oh, 
the thinks you can think up if only you try.
